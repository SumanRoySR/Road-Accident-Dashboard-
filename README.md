## 🛠️  Deep Insights

- 🚗 **Cars** account for the majority of casualties, indicating a need for safer urban vehicle regulations.
- 🌆 **Urban** areas see the highest number of accidents (61.9%), despite lower speeds, pointing to congestion and high vehicle density.
- 💡 **Daylight** accidents dominate (73.8%), suggesting volume and driver distraction may play a greater role than visibility.
- 🛣️ **Single carriageways** are the most accident-prone road type, an indicator for infrastructure improvement.
- 🌧️ **Weather-related** factors like rain contribute to accident spikes, emphasizing the need for road safety campaigns during monsoons/wet seasons.
- 📉 **Year-over-year** decrease in casualties and fatal incidents signals possible effectiveness of policy or safety interventions.

## 🎯 Potential Business Actions Based on Insights
- Upgrade **single carriageways** to reduce accident concentration.
- Improve **traffic control** and **pedestrian** safety in urban areas.
- Launch targeted **safety campaigns** for high-risk vehicle types like cars.
- Address **daytime** accidents with distracted driving prevention measures.
- Enhance **road safety** during adverse weather through alerts and infrastructure.
- Allocate resources to high-risk zones identified through **geospatial data**.
